# brepl

The Clojure script browser repl.

## Usage

'''bash
lein deps
'''

In ./brepl make sure your CLOJURESCRIPT_HOME is set to wherever clojurescript is on your macine.

'''
./brepl
'''

Then just open the included index.html in a browser that supports websockets (only tested in chrome so far).
Results are printed to the browser's console, so make sure you have it open.

## Notes

ClojureScript doesn't have a (require) function in cljs.core, so I've implemented one for brepl, which I can't
guarantee will act the same as (ns some-ns (:require ...)), though I haven't seen any differences.
